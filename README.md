# Python-Chess 
This is a chess project I started to develop fluency for myself in Python!

## Current Features
* Fully working chess game written from scratch
* Special chess rules including en passant, castling, and pawn upgrade
* Launch menu to choose your game mode
* Local player versus player (on the same device)
* Random cpu opponent
* Intelligent cpu opponent using the minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning - still buggy

## Installation
1. Install Python 3
1. Use pip to install tkinter, PIL, and anytree
1. Run main.py to start the program

## TODO
 * Write neural network game mode
 * Add checkmate indication
 * Write local network multiplayer
 * More thoroughly document items
 * Clean up everything - many parts are implemented inefficiently
 * Fix unknown bugs in the game
 * Implement more threading
 * Implement smooth drag and drop graphics
 * Make more compatible with alternate resolutions
