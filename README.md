# Python-Chess
This is a personal chess project I started to develop fluency in Python.

## Current Features
* Fully working chess game written from scratch
* Special chess rules including en passant, castling, and pawn upgrade
* Launch menu to choose your game mode
* Local player versus player (on the same device)
* Random cpu opponent
* Intelligent cpu opponent using a tree algorithm - Work in Progress

## Installation
1. Install Python 3
1. Use pip to install tkinter, PIL, and anytree
1. Install graphviz if you want to output generated trees to svg files
1. Run main.py to start the program

## TODO
 * Write neural network game mode
 * Add checkmate rules
 * Write local network multiplayer
 * More thoroughly document items
 * Clean up everything - many parts are implemented inefficiently
 * Fix unknown bugs in the game
 * Implement more threading
 * Implement smooth drag and drop graphics
 * Implement minmax algorithm and dynamically check trees as they are created
